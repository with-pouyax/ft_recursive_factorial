# ft_recursive_factorial


This repository is dedicated to showcasing the `ft_recursive_factorial` function, a custom implementation that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. This approach provides a clear example of how recursion can be utilized in programming to solve problems that have a naturally recursive structure.

## Function Overview

The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`, symbolized by `n!`. The `ft_recursive_factorial` function implements this calculation in a recursive manner, making the code concise and easy to understand.

### Function Prototype

```c
int ft_recursive_factorial(int nb);
